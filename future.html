	 <h2> Highschool Choice  </h2>
	  <p>For my highschool choices, I chose Ernest McBride Highschool and Lakewood Highschool.  The reason I chose Lakewood Highschool as a choice is that it is my homeschool, and I chose Ernest McBride Highschool since, it seems like a nice pretty small school with pathways that drew me in and honestly it seems like the best highschool for me to go to since my grades are bad.
	     Also for my pathway choices I chose; Medicine, Criminal Justice and Investigation and Engineering. </p>
	 
	 <h3>Career Interest</h3>
     <p> Personally I am interested in medicine and law mostly for career options and what I will do in the future. In the medical field I would like to work as a neurosurgeon, who operates on the nervous system, or plastic surgeon who reconstructs the human body, or a psychologist who helps people who have gone through anything traumatic or scarring and help them with their mental health. Also for law I would like to be either a lawyer, prosecutor or judge and be a fair person that makes the judicial system better. Lastly for careers that interest me, I would like to be a artist manager, mostly to help people like my two friends who's dream is to become a k-pop idol and help them achieve it.</p>
