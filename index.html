<h2> About Myself</h2>
 <p>My family consist of me, my brother, mom and dad. Unfortunately I do not know very much information on my family and relatives in general and what I do know is very small. My family and relatives that I do know are only the ones living in CA. Also anything including my family is very personal for me, so I would rather not say anything about them or including them. So there is only so much I will say about them. My family comes from a hispanic and latino background that is mixed with other ethnicities such as Spaniard.  </p>
