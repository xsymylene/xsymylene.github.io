<h2> Skills </h2>
	    <p> Skills are not something I really have, or they're just really dull and clear. As a bilingual, a skill is my Spanish and English, also I can understand some French and Italian but more of the writing then speaking, and hopefully my Korean, Mandarin and Japanese skills become amazing down the road, since I only know some words. Sherlock Holmes am I your disciple? Detective skills come pretty in hand when your reasearching for whatever reason for school or who knows, more like you know. </p>
		    
	    
	   <h3> When I'm bored (hobbies)</h3>
	    <p> Honestly I don't really have alot of hobbies, but here they are although their mostly things I do when i'm bored. First things first, for years, I have been watching anime and more currently but also for several years I have been watching dramas, and not latino ones, don't even try to stereotype me, I mostly watch K-Dramas, T-Dramas and sometimes J-Dramas and C-Dramas. When I am not watching dramas or anime, I watch V-live, although its hard to understand when you only understand "Annyeonghasyeo! Saranghaehasyeo!" with extra aeygo TT. Another thing I do is watch music videdos from artist like BTS, EXO and BlackPink, and dance choreographies then attempt to do the dance choreographies but most likely end up sadly failing TT. </p>   
	 
	    
	    <h4> My Interest </h4>
	    <p>For my few small interest, I will tell only you. A really big interest of mine is music especially alternative (rock,punk,etc.), kpop, k-hiphop, and c-pop. Another interest of mine is dramas, oh how enchanting and amazing they are! K-dramas, J-Dramas,C-Dramas and T-Dramas are spectacular, Saranghae Park Shin Hye. You probably just know Ghibli Studios and Pokemon, as anime, well for my anime is something greater, and all the great effort in making it shows of in the animation. My other interest are Medicine and Psychology since it interest me how the body works, the anatomy of it and how our minds work, how we act and the reasoning and meaning behind it. Another interest of mine which, I whole-heartedly love is Philosophy, the great minds that created this, the thoughts of it and within it is really incredible . Lastly another interest of mine is literature, I love reading and everything that makes up a book, the words, plot, character, etc.

<h5> Me,myself and not I </h5>
<p> My family comes from a hispanic and latino background that is mixed with other ethnicities such as Spaniard and consist of mom ,dad, brother and myself. Also I do not feel comfortable talking about anything private and personal, so that is all about my family. </p>
