	    <h3> When I'm bored (hobbies)</h3>
	    <p> Honestly I don't really have alot of hobbies, but here they are although their mostly things I do when i'm bored. First things first, for years, I have been watching anime and more currently but also for several years I have been watching dramas, and not latino ones, don't even try to stereotype me, I mostly watch K-Dramas, T-Dramas and sometimes J-Dramas and C-Dramas. When I am not watching dramas or anime, I watch V-live, although its hard to understand when you only really know "Annyeonghasyeo! Saranghaehasyeo!" with extra aeygo TT. Another thing I do is watch music videdos from artist like BTS, EXO and BlackPink, and dance choreographies then attempt to do the dance choreographies but most likely end up sadly failiing. </p>
